## Getting Started

### Virtual Environment

Downloading python packages is bloaty, so we use a virtual environment to keep things clean. Run these commands in the terminal.

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
```

### YAML File

Create a yaml file named secrets.yaml in the same directory as the python file. The yaml file should look like this:

```yaml
# secrets.yaml
sender_email: "sender_email@gmail.com"
sender_password: "app_password"
recipient_email: "recipient_email@gmail.com"
```

The app password is separate from your normal google account password and is generated like so:
